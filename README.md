<h2>General Information 📘</h2>
<hr>
<ul>
    <li><strong>The <i>Sentiment Analysis API</i></strong> is a FastAPI-based web service designed to analyze the sentiment of input text, classifying it as either positive or negative. It utilizes a machine learning model that was trained on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com" target="_blank">Kaggle</a> and is deployed in a Dockerized container. The service can be accessed via a simple RESTful API endpoint, making it easy to integrate into any application that requires sentiment analysis capabilities. 🧠</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>This API provides a quick and efficient way to analyze the sentiment of text, helping businesses or developers build applications that can assess user feedback, social media comments, or any other form of text data. The model identifies whether the sentiment of a piece of text is positive or negative, offering insights into customer opinions, product reviews, and more. 💬</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>The purpose of this project is to showcase a practical application of machine learning for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, specifically sentiment analysis. By containerizing the model (Logistic Regression with TF-IDF Vectorizer) and deploying it as a web service, the project demonstrates how to integrate machine learning models into scalable applications with modern deployment practices like Docker 🐋 and CI/CD pipelines using <a href="https://github.com/features/actions" target="_blank">GitHub Actions</a>. 🔄</li>
